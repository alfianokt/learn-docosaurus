# Getting Started

Let's discover **Dococ in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**:

```shell
npx app@next
```

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```shell
cd my-website

npm run start
```

Your site starts at `http://localhost:3000`.

Open `docs/intro.md` and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and display your changes.
